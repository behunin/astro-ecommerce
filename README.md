## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ cart/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ checkout/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ incentives/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ order/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ products/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ promo/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ reviews/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ store/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dashboardContext.tsx
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ footer.tsx
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ navbar.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ index.astro
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ landing.astro
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ product.astro
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ shopping-cart.astro
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                             |
